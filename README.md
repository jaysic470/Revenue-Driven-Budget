## Introduction

The telecom company **Megaline** offers two prepaid plans. This project uses usage data to compare the monthly revenue of each plan and examine user patterns across demographics and regions. The goal is to support data-driven marketing and resource allocation.

---

## Data Sources

The project uses several datasets, including:

- **users_df**: user demographics and plan type
- **calls_df**: call logs and durations
- **messages_df**: text message volumes
- **internet_df**: internet usage in MB
- **plans_df**: pricing and monthly plan allowances

---

## Project Goals

- Calculate and compare monthly revenue generated by the **Surf** and **Ultimate** plans.
- Analyze user activity by city and region.
- Determine whether revenue differences between plans are statistically significant.
- Provide actionable recommendations for advertising budget allocation.

## Process Overview

1. **Data Overview & Import**  
   Multiple datasets are loaded and inspected to assess structure and completeness.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Conversion of data types  
   - Merging and cleaning datasets  
   - Handling missing values and anomalies

3. **Revenue Calculations**  
   Monthly revenue was calculated by:
   - Applying plan pricing and overage fees
   - Grouping by user and month

4. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - T-tests to compare plan revenue  
   - Evaluation by region and customer activity

---

## Key Findings

- Users on the **Ultimate plan** generated more consistent and higher revenue on average.
- The **Surf plan** had greater variability due to overage charges.
- Urban regions showed slightly higher usage but not a statistically significant revenue difference.

---

## Business Recommendations

- Focus advertising dollars on **Ultimate plan** conversion for existing Surf users.
- Consider bundling data overages or tiered pricing for Surf users to stabilize revenue.
- Segment campaigns by region, but do not prioritize city-based targeting unless paired with usage trends.
